I can&#39;t speak for us all here, but anecdotal evidence for me indicates that most people I know put the milk in first before the cereal because:<br>• it&#39;s more economical (you&#39;ll know exactly how much milk-to-cereal you&#39;ll have, reducing wastage of both);<br>• most people I know prefer warm milk to cold milk (tastes better, not to mention nuking it in the microwave makes certain that any bugs present are dead), and for this, you can heat the milk then add the cereal after, so you can have cereal with warm milk <i>without</i> the cereal getting soggy, like would happen if you were to microwave them both in the bowl []\n",

Even a little practice will help Calm and channel the energy (prana) within you in a positive way soothing the nerves which are getting overstimulated. Your cabin time seems to demonstrate that locking the phone away was beneficial. Maybe some period of each day could be set aside to do this, But obviously you can’t hide from your tech for the whole day. Hence a compelling reason to try some powerful yoga meditation techniques.

Trust me, we had 20 long hair Persians, that we helped a Breeder get new homes, and at that time, I too was told, “You’re DEATHLY ALLERGIC to Cat’s!  One good bite or Scratch, and you’ll go into shock!  I just said, “They’re not GOING, and if that’s the case, then so be it!”  A few years later, I found out that the Majority of People have SEVERE Allergies, and don’t know it, because they’re being constantly exposed to them.  (My Fun Fact:  I can remember the most absurd Fact, look at the Cat’s 😂🤣😂🤣😂  But, if you tell me something personal or something you don’t want anyone to know, I immediately forget it!!  My Niece didn’t believe me, until she asked me a question about her Family she told me, and I just told her, “I told you, Personal Information you tell me, is GONE!  Then she forget she moved something, and wouldn’t let me talk, so I said, “If YOU let me Talk, you’ll HAVE IT!”  She said “Go Ahead!”  I said “When you were moving it, I you were putting in YOUR JUNK DRAWER.” She replied “MY JUNK DRAWER?!?”  I said, “NO!  Your Junk Drawer!”  She went and looked, and there it was!  Don’t ask me why I’m like this, I’ve tried to figure it out for 55 years of the 62 years, I’ve been alive!!!  😂🤣😂🤣😂)<br><br>Congrats on your Hard Work, Upcoming Wedding, and Billions more subscribers!!!

      "Arun must be very happy having such an active community. It has been 10 minutes and there already so many comments. ['@DemonencrafterNow this is getting confusing but yeah you would be the first to say first on the video but that&#39;s different then actually being first like if I won a race I can&#39;t just be like yeah I didn&#39;t place 1st but I was the 1st one to say 1st', '@RetroGamesDude I thought first was just to represent that you‘re the earliest on a certain video. But if you’re right wouldn’t that mean you’re the first to say &quot;first&quot;', '@Demonencrafter So if there is a video with millions of views and no one in the comments section said first and you say first in the comments section that means you&#39;re first', 'ok', '@ReadyBear64It doesn’t matter I will be flushed away by like beggars and verified comments.']\n",
